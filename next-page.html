       <strong><h2>Prediction Entry:</h2></strong><br> Enter your predictions for each selected match. Predict the exact number of goals scored by each team. You might also predict whether the match will end in a win, loss, or draw.

       <strong> Points Calculation:</strong> <br>Points are awarded based on the accuracy of your predictions:

            If you correctly predict the exact number of goals for both teams, you earn a certain number of points (e.g., 100 points).
            Predicting the correct result (win, lose, or draw) but not the exact score might earn fewer points (e.g., 50 points).
        <strong>Leaderboard:</strong><br> Monitor the leaderboard on the official website to see your ranking among other participants based on your total points accumulated throughout the contest. <br><br><br> <br><br>

        <strong>Follow-up Matches:</strong><br> Repeat the prediction process for each subsequent match throughout the Euro Cup 2024 tournament. You can continue to make predictions for multiple matches to increase your chances of earning more points.
